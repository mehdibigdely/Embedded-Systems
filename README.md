#  Emerging Sys Arch & Tech 

I've developed two C-written projects tailored for the TI SimpleLink CC3220S board, accompanied by videos showcasing their outputs. Both projects were crafted using Code Composer Studio (TI). The primary project, a thermostat application, employs a TMP006 temperature sensor to read room temperature via I2C. It features an LED indicating the thermostat's output, with the LED on representing the heating function (via GPIO). Additionally, two buttons enable the adjustment of the set temperature through GPIO interrupts, while UART simulates data sent to the server.

The second project, an SOS simulation, entails blinking the green, yellow, and red LEDs in the board's lower right corner. This synchronous state machine generates a pattern of blinking lights, conveying messages in Morse code (initially set as SOS and OK but customizable). Pressing a button changes the Morse code message of the blinking LEDs from SOS to OK or vice versa.

Throughout the coding and compilation processes, I garnered insights into microcontrollers, particularly focusing on the thermostat project. Notably, I delved into three prominent microcontroller options: Microchip's LCD-Drive Microcontroller (an 8-bit MCU known for its precise time measurement capabilities), Freescale's 45-nm Communications Processor (tailored for high-performance communication applications), and TI's Real-Time Microcontroller (offering versatility for real-time control).

Shifting focus to the wireless thermostat project, three specific microcontroller units take center stage: SimpleLink CC3220S, SAM-IOT, and Freedom Development Platform for Kinetis MCUs from NXP. The SimpleLink CC3220S, with its affordability, rich WiFi capabilities, and support for multiple modes and security features, emerges as a recommended choice. SAM-IOT from Microchip, akin to the SimpleLink CC3220S, offers WiFi connectivity and essential components, including a built-in debugger. However, NXP's Freedom Development Platform FRDM-KW40Z, although feature-rich, raises concerns about cost-effectiveness due to its higher price. In conclusion, the SimpleLink CC3220S proves to be the most favorable option for the thermostat project, ensuring affordability, feature richness, and robust WiFi capabilities for secure cloud integration.
