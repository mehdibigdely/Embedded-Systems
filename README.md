#  Emerging Sys Arch & Tech 

I've  developed two C-written projects tailored for the TI SimpleLink CC3220S board, showcasing their outcomes in accompanying video links. Utilizing Code Composer Studio (TI) for both projects, the primary one is a thermostat application employing a TMP006 temperature sensor to read room temperature via I2C. It includes an LED indicating the thermostat's output (heating function via GPIO) and two buttons facilitating set temperature adjustment through GPIO interrupts, with UART simulating data sent to the server.

Despite encountering challenges, especially with low-level code and drivers, and being relatively new to embedded systems coding, I achieved the desired outcomes through perseverance, trial and error, and extensive document reading, including driver header files. Limited online resources, such as StackOverflow forums or YouTube videos, made the projects more challenging. Once I grasped concepts like interruptions, timers, and callback functions, I implemented them in various scenarios. For instance, in the SOS project, I used the right button to control the blinking speed of LEDs sending Morse messages, dynamically adjusting the speed and resetting it to the default period when too fast. Detailed comments in the code enhance readability, and state machine diagrams served as references to ensure all requirements were met.

Transferrable lessons for future projects include the resilience and hard work required when encountering unfamiliar topics. I've learned that the best sources for learning are the original developer/manufacturer Technical Reference Manuals or source codes. The second project involves an SOS simulation, blinking LEDs in Morse code (initially set as SOS and OK but customizable). Pressing a button changes the Morse code message of the blinking LEDs from SOS to OK or vice versa.

Throughout the coding and compilation processes, I gained insights into microcontrollers, focusing on the thermostat project. Delving into three prominent microcontroller options: Microchip's LCD-Drive Microcontroller, Freescale's 45-nm Communications Processor, and TI's Real-Time Microcontroller. Shifting focus to the wireless thermostat project, three specific microcontroller units take center stage: SimpleLink CC3220S, SAM-IOT, and Freedom Development Platform for Kinetis MCUs from NXP. The SimpleLink CC3220S, with its affordability, rich WiFi capabilities, and support for multiple modes and security features, emerges as a recommended choice, ensuring affordability, feature richness, and robust WiFi capabilities for secure cloud integration.
